## ‚≠êÔ∏è How to make the db work

We are using [Turso](https://turso.tech) for the db with [Drizzle (ORM)](https://orm.drizzle.team/).
The first thing we have to do is make sure we have Turso installed in our system, so please check [installation guide](https://docs.turso.tech/quickstart).
Then the steps are the following:

```node
turso auth signup --> login
turso db create <<nameofdb>> --> create a new db close to your location
turso db show <<nameofdb>> --> gives you info about the db
```

In my case I called my db `collabender-dev-db` in local environment.

We need to run now the following command in order to get the authentication token.

```node
turso db tokens create <<nameofdb>>
```

We will store this info in our `.env` like this:

````node
TURSO_CONNECTION_URL=libsql... (you will find this one in the Turso settings of your db)
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=<<generatedcode>>
```

You can after that generate a migration to check how it looks like and then run the migration
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit migrate
````
